# Room Regions

This crate provides region analysis of rooms in the programmable MMO Screeps: World.

It relies entirely on the local versions of room data, meaning it can be run both online and offline without modifications.

## Planned Improvements

* Expose exit tiles from room analysis
* Expose exit regions from room analysis
* Add border tile region adjacency aggregation and reporting
* Add region-based border tiles reporting for adjacency checking against other regions
